      "\n  I've had several GoPros (a half dozen over the years), and I'm a early-adopter of consumer 360 video. This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost.",
      "This GoPro Fusion is a beast. The housing is 2-3 times larger than even the largest other GoPro models, the battery is about twice as large, and the camera requires two micro-SD cards to even function (one card for the forward-facing lens, and one card for the rear-facing lens). The files are also HUGE (more on that later). Thankfully though, even though the camera is physically much larger than any other GoPro before it, it still uses the same versatile mounts.",
      "The GoPro Fusion looks and feels like a camera that has potential, but GoPro has got to get better file compression and make the app/software integration better. I was totally unable to stitch and render any 360 video on my phone because of the massive space requirements, so I downloaded the Windows 10 desktop software. When I then tried to stitch and render a video of approximately 1.5 minutes in length, I could see that the resulting file would take hours to render (not including the time it'd take to then upload it later to YouTube) and would be nearly six gigabytes in size. To be clear, that's one huge video. This estimated size I was given for a 1.5 minute video with the GoPro Fusion was the same as the average rip of a 2-hour Blu-Ray video.",
      "The sheer size of the files that the GoPro Fusion produces and the fact that the computer horsepower required to stitch and render them is quite significant makes this a no-go for me. Unless you're going to stick to filming videos of only a few seconds in length, any videos that are a few minutes in length will require hours of your time. That's just too heavy of a commitment for me to have the latest/greatest in \"wow\" factor videos. I'd rather invest the time and money in full-frame video from a mirrorless camera or using another GoPro action cam.",
      "To be clear, this camera has awesome potential and the image quality is outstanding (it's an absolute game changer). But the technology is so cutting edge that I don't see this being a practical camera unless you're a pro or pro-am with hardcore hardware and a lot of time on your hands.\n"

      "\n  I will update this review in a few days, there are a couple of statements I need to state.  First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for \"figuring it out\" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.  The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily.",
      "Only from reading, I understand that folks have had issues with the software.  GoPro, you have an edge right now, don't blow it because of crappy software, if you cant do it yourself partner with someone, but the software is probably more important than the hardware in making compelling 360 videos and 2D videos from 3D source.  Don't set the bar and then let others cross it because of inferior software.  Bite the bullet and just fix it.",
      "Amazon, I hope you are reading this, you would do buyers a great service if you could post a quick start guide for buyers and potential buyers, not a video for 360 fanboys, but a quick start guide for folks like me, who want to take immersive video while on vacation.  I will try to put together a quick guide over the next couple of weeks and post it, but Amazon, you stand to make lots of sales if you can show how the 80% of folks can get what they need from this camera by understanding 20% of its capabilities.\n"

    "review_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2018",
    "review_text": [
      "\n  I'll start by saying that the Fusion delivers really clean 5.2 K spherical video and it's really fun to shoot with. Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them).\n"

      "\n  The camera seems to take excellent 360 photos, and short videos as far as I can see from my mobile gopro app. But the big caveat is that the desktop software, Fusion Studio, that you are supposed to use to unload all of the massive images and videos to your desktop simply does not work.  Trying to connect my camera to my mac has taken hours, and it still isn't working.  It is NOT simple plug and play.  This is clearly a known issue due to the number of times the connectivity problem appears in online gopro help forums, but there is simply no substantive help that works anywhere.  This is extremely frustrating - you spend time taking videos and you rely on the camera, and you cannot unload the footage without popping the cards out and unloading those - that is a much more complex method than on a normal gopro  or other digital camera. Very very frustrating for such an expensive camera.\n"

      "\n  The iPhone app is buggy, but you don't need it, it's a 360, think about your placement of the camera and shoot.  The images are night and day over my Insta360 Nano, as it can shoot in night and day too.  The Fusion software running on a 2010 Mac Pro 5.1, is so far rock steady doing almost 100 clips.  My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with.",

      "This is more of a professional workflow camera, if you just want to do quick 360 video or photo, get an Insta360 Nano S.  If your aspiring for more, get a Fusion.  The only drawbacks are, the audio really picks up even a slight breeze, and one of the sides has a more noticeable stitch line then the other.  Image wise, this one looks nice.\n"

      "\n  Alright, let's get the camera information out of the way: First of all, yes it does record 360. It goes underwater just fine, and I've used it in pools, at the beach, and everywhere. However, the design of the software is something to be desired.",
      "Before I move on, you *will* need two MicroSD cards to shove into this camera. I recommend at least 64gb, since the files can get quite large. Both MicroSD cards will contain the video/pictures from a single individual camera *but* on both cards, neither card will have a stitched-together version of any videos/pictures that it generates. The GoPro Fusion requires you either use a stitching program *or* you use the GoPro Fusion Studio. I'll go over the base apps later on.",
      "So, the setup is... standard. Charge it up, and it can start taking 360 Video and Pictures. The Camera Tripod it comes with is nice, but its really short (2 feet is good enough if you put it on a table). It'll work fantastic as a selfie stick, or a table-mount, but you'll want to purchase a nice 4-6 foot Tripod with a GoPro Screw mount if you expect you're going to place it on the ground. It also comes with a curved and straight 3M Mount if you want to put it on a dashboard or a helmet. These 3M Sticky mounts are cool, but are permanent. If you're always going to mount your 360 Camera on the surface, its worth it. Otherwise, if you're doing something like 360 Footage from a vehicle, I highly recommend getting a Suction Cup mount.",
      "Now, I'm going to go over the Base GoPro App. It connects, about 6 out of 10 times, and when it does connect, you'll have about 120 seconds before the GoPro App freezes its picture. After 3 reconnections, the GoPro Fusion will refuse 100% of connections, even if video is currently recording. Bottom line, the GoPro App is made for setup, but not for monitoring. The stitching on the App is bock standard, and the only thing you can do with Stitched Pictures/Video is post to Facebook. You can't even download the Stitched Pictures/Video to your local device on Android to use in other apps, which is annoying.",
      "Switching to the PC GoPro Fusion Studio, I can tell you, this app needs to be fixed up quite a bit. It can stitch, but that's all you're going to do. The GoPro Fusion has a *very* terrible time trying to determine an actual stable horizon, making videos crooked once uploaded. If you need to fix Horizon line, I would suggest pulling in the Stitched Picture/Video into your favorite 3D Picture/Video Editor (I use Adobe Premiere CC) to adjust the horizon. The base app sucks at helping you fix the horizon line, as its built for a 2D Image with 3D Purposes. There's no trick to it, its just the GoPro Fusion doesn't record the level point, or the GoPro Fusion App doesn't read level horizon properly. However, despite all of this, I can tell you that, it can keep the *same* horizon line in the App for a video for the entire video (if you enable Full Stabilization), which means you don't have to worry about choosing the manual horizon line.",
      "Picture and Video quality is slightly lacking on this iteration. A 5.2k image *sounds* cool as a statistic, but, in practice, not so much. Remember, this image is stretched around a 360 image, which means that your pixels are about 2.8x the size of a normal 5.2k image. If you're in anything lower than outside sunlight, forget it. The ISO sensor they put in these GoPros is horrendous. Will it take a video/picture? Sure. However, be prepared for some pretty bad low ISO static all over your image. If you can't get a good image at 1600 ISO, I would recommend just putting the Fusion away because maximum ISO is *very* bad.",
      "I think its a good \"360 maker's\" first 360 Camera, but not much more than that. If you're considering any kind of hobby into 360 Photography, I would suggest something a little higher resolution, and with a better ISO sensor.\n"

      "\n  So, I chose this particular camera instead of the MAX for a few reasons. The first one, the price was right. The second one, it shoots RAW photos, which the newer GoPro VR Camera doesn't (at least not as of this review).",
      "Things that I like about this camera will focus on both my work and personal fun factor use.",
      "1: It came with the selfie pole that doubles as a tripod. This may seem trivial to many, but it's actually much better than I thought it would be. Depending on the angle and extension you hold it out, the pole is completely gone from the picture.",
      "2: The fact that the pole can be extended and retracted very easily is a big plus for carrying it everywhere and start shooting right away. Since it is a gopro accessory, you can also connect any other gopro or compatible action camera and accessory to it, if you won't use it for the fusion.",
      "3: Ruggedness. It feels solid and the rubbery case makes it so easy to handle without much concern of slippery fingers which could spell camera doom. The buttons are also easy to reach and use and just feels solid",
      "4: It's actually waterproof without any extra hardware! Ok, so you cannot go diving too deep with it, but it will still  work for some nice underwater, rainy day or watery footage you may want... but for deep diving, you will have to get a special case. Now, underwater footage isn't so good for VR, but is good enough in overcapture, which is what I use most of the time, lately.",
      "5: Almost unnoticeable stitch-line! This is a HUGE issue with many VR Cameras, and I have many! not even my 6 camera VR rig compares. Now, granted, you can remove almost completely the stitch-line using special software, but when I export to the Fusion software, it is almost unnoticeable 8 out 10.",
      "6: Faster Turn-in: ok, I know there are faster better in-camera stitching options out there, but for the price I paid, it's hard to complain. Take the footage, dump the SDs into a project folder, run fusion, tell it what to render as VR or overcapture and let it do it's thing. Photos are almost immediate. Video can take longer",
      "7: Timelapse Multishots: so I take bursts or timelapses as photos, because it will export the best, sharpest image I want... or create a short video if you prefer. your uses may vary, but I found it helpful for my work",
      "8: Battery Life: It may come as a surprise, but the battery actually lasts quite a bit! I bought additional batteries and the dual charger to always have it ready. Heck, there is hardly a day I don't go out without it. For work doing virtual tours for clients or just for fun, battery lasts a long time",
      "9: Image Stability: so I made sure to rough handle it to test its limits on motion sickness, but surprisingly, it is able to keep a nice horizon very nicely! Granted, there is a bit of shakiness still, but the stitch is also almost impossible to find even with the vibration of the drone, car, bike or jog. I'm still going to buy a sizable gimbal for overcapture footage, exclusively for this camera, but even with the selfie stick, I'm pleased so far.",
      "10: you can use the GoPro remotes independently or alongside other gopros, even if they aren't a fusion! It just works far better than expected!",
      "Now, there are a few things that I sort of don't like, but not a huge deal",
      "1: two microSD cards: ok, so I don't hate it, but having to have 2 cards all the time, and having to export both cards for each project is truly a little annoying and can be time consuming if it's 64 or 128GB per card that you are transferring out. But knowing how long it takes, makes it easier to set a timeframe for clients.",
      "2: stitching on the phone isn't quite as good as on the app itself. so it's good enough for personal facebook, but definitely not for delivering to clients. but when I do it for clients, I prefer doing it with the higher quality anyway, so RAW on photos and 4k ~ 5.2k on VR video or up to 3k on 2D video.",
      "3: app can be annoying to work at times. so it's not as bad as it once was, but it's definitely not as good as I'd like for it to be. But it gets the job done, even if it requires a few extra steps... for easy sessions I just use the gopro remote and I'm golden.",
      "4: No bracketing. If you aren't sure what that means, basically the ability to take underexposed, normal and overexposed photos at the same time, ranging from 1, 3, 5, 7 ~ levels. While you cannot do it in one shot, you can simulate it, but of course takes extra time. The benefit of this shines in RAW, because you can take really underexposed photos for better detail on bright windows, and overexposed photos to bring up the details in shadows. Combine all that in photoshop or other favorite software and voila!",
      "5: Finding the software on the GoPro site is extremely difficult and it's probably easier if you just google it, since it's pretty much hidden away on their website to promote their newer cameras... But it's still there... just harder to find...",
      "6: i cannot find anything else to complain about... the minor issues are just that: minor! All my other VR Cameras are now mostly for decoration in my office, except those for underwater",
      "I honestly didn't see anything that wowed me from the MAX, so the fusion is just as good if not better, with the only issue of lacking a built-in screen and needing 2 microSDs instead of 1.... but for the amount of footage I shoot in a day, I'd still be carrying 4 cards, anyway, so yeah....",
      "Anyway, I hope this review was helpful.\n"

      "-The stitching in the software is almost always on point, there will always be imperfections, but for the most part, stitching at eye level viewing angles is consistent.",
      "-Multi axis stabilization (software based stabilization) is very impressive, and holds the camera angle in place (in my case I've noticed by default it points north at the horizon, regardless of  how you physically move the camera) which makes for great footage from a moving vehicle going over rough terrain (emulates human head movement) or while walking and unintentionally twisting/tilting camera. In low light you do get some strange blurring, so I cannot always recommend using it, but you can choose whether you need it after recording your video.",
      "-Battery life is good; usually doesn't run out of battery during a day's worth of casual use. Probably had the battery run down over an 8 hour period with about an hour's worth of clips taken",

      "-requires a lot of hard drive space on your computer, I would recommend having about 4 TB available to sandbox around with this camera. Premiere will need more swap disk space than normal",
      "-need a newer computer to edit video, especially when using the reframe function. Don't expect your 6 or 7 year old computer to play nicely with this camera. It kind of works on my 7 year old desktop, but I get a lot of errors in Premiere. Works flawlessly on my new laptop.",
      "-about every minute of raw footage is about 1 GB of video files before stitching, files get bigger after stitching.",
      "Conclusion:",
      "If you are in the market for a 360 camera, and don't have a serious budget constraint, I would pick this camera, as it is made and supported by an American company. There are some great low budget cameras that have similar specs on the market, but they are from relatively new Chinese companies, so I don't know if I trust them to support the camera long term, even though gopro has been struggling themselves.\n"

Hopefully that will change in the future. It's a shame to not be able to use that and stay in the GoPro software.

If you buy a fusion, put both folders from GPfront and GPback (the front and back folders that show up on the cards when you record) into another folder together....call it \"footage\" or whatever. Then the GoPro software will import without the \"218\" error (and no explanation).......GoPro should have this right up front in their website or documentation....but that would be too easy. .Just trying to save someone else the hassle of researching this simple answer. cheers\n"

I looked at reviews and samples and wanted the highest possible image quality without getting in to professional costs, which lead me to the GoPro. It lives up to the hype on image quality, and the stabilization is awesome. That is unfortunately where the good note ends.",
      "The companion Android app is terrible, it's an awful UI, it's laggy, unresponsive, constantly losing wireless connection to the camera. It crashes often, can't export images out of the app to make available to the rest of the phone, frequently the live video feed would disappear. It's basically unusable, and since the camera doesn't have a reasonable self timer, there is no other good way to trigger the shutter without holding the camera with my face blocking half of the field of view, without of course buying another wireless remote that probably won't work well.",
      "The Fusion Studio application for stitching photos and videos together just straight up doesn't run on half of my computers, and the other half it runs poorly. It tends to hang, it comes with no useful documentation, you just kind of muddle through it blindly. The video encoder settings are limited to three codecs, two of which are not commonly useful for consumption by VR devices, and the third one limits the resolution for no reason. You can invoke the encoder from the command line and generate videos at the full 5.2k resolution no problem, and they look great, if it happens to run and finish and not crash that is. This is also not documented of course, I had to figure it out for myself.",
      "Finally, the included Fusion stick/tripod (which you must use because it doesn't have a standard tripod mount, unless you once again spend more money) broke on me the third time I tried to use it, the telescoping mechanism jammed and when I tried to unjam it, it just broke in half. Turns out the rugged GoPro product is held together by cheap glue and sloppy tolerance plastic shims. So, this is of course going straight back to Amazon.",

    "review_text": [
      "\n  Short and sweet.  How can a camera of this price, category, and technology omit the MOST BASIC OF ALL CAMERA FUNCTIONS?  I can think of no camera released in the past 10yrs that costs 1/10th of this one that blows off the implementation of Exposure and White Balance Control.  Literally, you CANNOT lock your exposure or WB and cannot choose shutter speeds.  Sure..AUTO EVERYTHING with a simple +/- EV control can work fine in easy environments... but go in and out of shadows, mixed light...shoot time lapse, etc and watch that exposure and white balance bounce all over the place.  I honestly expected more from GoPro and it never even crossed my mind that these BASIC features would be excluded.  For me, I may just have to return it as I cannot accept these limitations no matter how great it looks in bright even sunlight.  PLEASE FIX THIS and I may repurchase.  Interesting that there are so many comments marked \"Helpful\" when they are \"rah rah\"...but there are some big-time shortcomings that people should consider and not be swayed exclusively by only positive reviews.  One additional - Be sure you don't mind a 10x-15x to 1 rendering ratio on even the latest of computers.  1min of footage will take 10-15min to render.  For reference, my latest top of line Macbook Pro it's 10 to 1.\n"

      "Pros:",
      "-GoPro built",
      "-less buggy than the Rylo",
      "-the remote interface on the phone to control the camera is great, but it's very buggy",

      "-the stitching is awesome, easy and brainless (no small feat)",
      "Cons:",
      "-The remote interface is buggy.",
      "-128GB (64G x2) will only give you about 2h40min of recording time at 3k resolution",
      "-most importantly.... the 5.2k just isn't enough.  Once my basketball videos were taken and editing or watching with the overcapture feature at 5.2k, the players were completely undiscernable and fuzzy.  Not a problem using a GoPro 5 Blk at 720 or 1080p.",
      "-chomps through the battery in a short time, better to use an external battery for long planned recordings",
      "Here it is.  If you want a camera to record your self going down the slopes, riding a wave, skateboarding or whatnot but don't plan to zoom in and don't mind the reduced resolution (5.2k is a lot, but not considering when you think it covers ALL 360 degrees at ALL elevations) - this is your camera.  It's better than the competition.",
      "The remote software on the iPhone IS buggy.  constantly crashes and you have to exit it and start over again to gain control of the camera.  Loses the camera's wifi from time to time despite being within 5 feet of it.  The remote viewing konks out from time to time as well - again fixed by exiting and restarting.  This will probably get fixed with firmware/app updates.",
      "Again, I'm recording basketball games from the sideline.  Zooming in to capture 1/2 of the court does make the video very very fuzzy as 5.2k just isn't enough.  Remember, it's 5.2k all 360 degrees and then UP and Down.  Therefore even a 2k, 720 etc is far more resolution for the framed screen than this one.",
      "Three stars to GoPro for this effort.  I get it.... it's hard.  5.2k is a lot to record and the file sizes get huge.  They did an amazing effort on the easy to do stitching.  The firmware/software is buggy at best.  They easily beat the current competition.  However at $800 this is not the camera to record sports for watching afterwards if you need greater or equal resolution to your current GoPro.",
      "After trying three 360 degree cameras, I've come to the conclusion that NO current 360 setup is technologically here yet.  The professional VR rigs you can buy for $10k and require lots of editing and stitching will do it, but for a consumer, it's just not here and technological hurdles still need to be solved/invented.\n"

      "There is very very limited support for Android devices at the moment, in fact this isn't supported at all on the Galaxy S5, my cheapo Chinese Android tablet, my galaxy S8+  nor is it supported on my Galaxy Tab 3.  The only android device I can get it to work with is a Galaxy S7.  Even then, the most you can do is download short 30 second video clips.  You cannot even download or edit any of the video or photos it takes with your android device.  However, don't worry, as according to gopro, you can use the desktop PC app \"Fusion Studio\" to retrieve and edit your footage.  Great for all of those on the go people who want to take photo's or shoot short video's, just bring your entire desktop PC with you...  However that Laptop or PC better be running Windows 10, it better have 8GB of ram because if not, even the GoPro fusion studio itself won't work.  Seriously, until this device gets full Android support, I would honestly skip on buying it for now.  There are cheaper and more compatible options out there.",
      "**updated 6/26/2018**",
      "Finally some updates worth talking about.  Android does have some support at this time, however the app is a bit strange to deal with.  You first of all have to download the 360 footage to your phone via the app (and you can only download it directly to the phone and not the SD card, this means that you're limited to about a 33 second clip).  You then have to exit out of the camera on the app, go into the splash screen, select \"media\", select the \"local\" tab and then edit your footage from there.  You can take a screen shot (photo) and re-frame it, then upload to facebook or instagram.  You can also do the same with 33 seconds of 360 footage.  You basically record the angle you want, but while recording you can pinch to zoom in or out or you can turn your phone around in your hands in the internal gyroscope will track your movement.  This however can lead to slightly jerky looking footage, you may want to sit yourself in an office chair and spin around slowly for a panning effect.  On one hand the inability to do smooth pans via the app is bad, on the other hand, who ever thought you could use an office chair as a video editing tool?  That's actually kinda fun.  The main problem though is the lack of video stabilization, you only get that by using Fusion Studio on your PC.  You also can't put any graphs on your footage (info taken from the GPS) unless your run it through the Fusion Studio either.",
      "I raised my review by one star for finally getting some android support, but I still think this camera is too big, too square and lacking in proper hardware based solutions to be a true 360 breakthrough camera.  I hope that if GoPro do another version, they address these issues and improve the usability of their app.",
      "UPDATED: 8/31/2018:",
      "So I've updated my review after owning this camera for quite a while and now I have to say, it's my favorite gopro to shoot video with.  I find that the ability to reframe shots after you've recorded them to be immense fun as well as hugely practical.  It's like having multiple cameras set up for a shoot.  However the problem with this camera is that you'll get back exactly what you put into it.  If you just buy the camera and only expect to use your android device to edit video with, then you're going to end up with shakey video, poor pans and the ability to only export 33 seconds at a time.  To get better use out of the camera, you're going to have to get either a PC or Laptop with some very decent specs and use the Go Pro Fusion Studio software.  That  gives you full camera stabilization (which borders on supernatural at times it can be so smooth) but you're looking at quite a cost (I spent about $1300 on my setup).  However, the fusion software only lets you export a static view (so no active panning or zooming shots).  Which means to get full use out of the software and footage, you're going to have to export your footage as a 360 degree video and then import it into something like Adobe Premier Pro (which will cost you about $25 per month for a license).  Only then will you be able to make the stunning video's you want.  So shooting in 360 gets awfully expensive fast............... and yet...  I'm finding it's worth it.  Not only is the video footage stunning but the options for your finished product are endless.  Although I love the image quality produced by the GoPro Hero 6, it's the ability to reframe, pan and zoom in post production that makes the GoPro fusion really stand out.  I wasn't impressed when I first got it, but now that I've owned it for a while, I'm loving what I can do with this camera and what lies down the road for me.  It may not be 5 stars due to the costs involved, but it's a very well earned 4 stars.",

      "You need yet another separate 3rd party software package to pull GPS data from the camera.",
      "At the end of the day, this camera isn't really suited to those who want to spend a minimum amount of time making \"point and shoot\" clips.  However for those willing to invest the time, energy and money into producing stunning footage, then you can't go wrong with this camera.  GoPro need to throw their resources into providing stable easy to use software that takes full advantage of the Fusions capabilities as this is where most of the flaws and bad user experiences stem from.  If they did that, then they'd easily have a 5 star product that anyone could use.  Until then, this camera earns itself a solid four star rating.\n"

      "\n  I will not reiterate the criticisms of other users that are well documented (long transfer and render times). My biggest issue is that the desktop app does not allow for key framing of the over capture files. That is to say when you convert a 360 video to a regular video you can only re-frame in one static direction. If the subject of the video moves in relation to the initial direction you have directed the overcapture then you are stuck.  For me this is a major shortcoming. I am fine with long transfer and render times if the output is good (which it is). However, if you can not create the cool panning effects or in and out of the 'small planet view' then what is the point of shooting 360? Insta360 and Rylo apps both support this feature in the free editing app. I realize there are plugins for Adobe Premiere that allow this, but this is not a solution for those of us with investments in other editors.\n"

      "The camera has two lenses facing in opposite directions, slightly offset, each capturing a spherical field of vision (FOV) image. It can be used for regular and slow motion videos along with still and time-lapse photography. Various settings are possible using the 3/4 inch square LED screen on the camera by cycling through the options with the mode and shutter buttons. The beauty of shooting 350 degrees, particularly in an action sequence is a view finder isn\u2019t a necessity because everything is being captured.",
      "Most of the settings are also available on a connected Apple or Android mobile device. Some functions are also accessible with voice commands, such as--GoPro Start Video and GoPro Stop Video, etc. Utilizing the voice option can inadvertently stop and start recording if the name is said within ear-shot of the device so there are times it may be best disabled.",
      "It requires two not-included microSD cards. I used two 32GB SanDisk Ultras one each for the front and back lenses so when a picture or video is captured there is one 180 degree image on each card. The free GoPro software on the website for either mobile, PC or Mac stitches the two together for a 360 degree image.",
      "A connected mobile device can be used to control the camera for capturing videos or photos and viewing them using the free GoPro app. The mobile device software on the website also provides some limited editing and file sharing capabilities.",
      "The PC or Mac software offers the most comprehensive options so Images from the device can be copied, viewed and edited. From the official home site, I downloaded free Fusion Studio 1.2.1.400, VR Player 3.0.5, and Quik 2.6.1.780.",
      "Captured files can be viewed or edited on a PC or Mac, either directly from the camera connected to a USB port, or copied by taking the microSD cards out of the camera and copying them to the computer\u2019s hard drive.",
      "I plugged the camera into a Dell Laptop running the latest version of Windows 10. Two drives appeared in the list of storage devices--Fusion Front and Fusion Back. All file names consist of a sequential four digit number preceded by \u201cGPFR\u201d or \u201cGPBK\u201d for the front and back images respectively. Photos are stored as \u201cjpg\u201d files and videos are \u201cmp4\u201d files.",
      "The Studio software requires 8 GB of available memory in Windows, and although I have that installed on my laptop it displayed a message saying there was not enough memory to run the program. A button with the message--Return to Fusion appeared and when clicked the program seemed to work anyway, presenting the choice to load from the attached camera or to find the files on the disk.",
      "Editing video was very slow and choppy directly from the camera, so I copied the files to the PC hard drive by inserting the microSD cards into the computer\u2019s card reader. The program warned me once again that there was not enough memory, but continued to work.",
      "The editing was a bit faster and less choppy, but the software crashed a few times and had to be re-started--certainly not optimal. Later, I tried again on a desktop Windows 10 computer with 16 GB of memory, and the editing was much smoother, faster and did not crash.",
      "This is a complex device and requires dedication to master. With the Studio software, the spherical photo or video can be turned into something that looks like it was shot from a regular digital camera. This I relatively amazing because when you are capturing the image, the camera does not have to be pointed at anything in particular. It records everything above, below, in front or behind.",
      "Using the software, with the tools included, it can be re-framed with OverCapture, stabilized, stitched, rendered, and colored so the final product can be a still or a video that includes things you didn\u2019t even know you were recording. The software has improved from the original release and should continue to evolve so it will be easier to use.",
      "Setup Details. Initially when the app started it connected to the camera and indicated there was a software update but in spite of repeated attempts it just wouldn\u2019t load. I checked the website\u2019s support area and browsed the detailed User Guide and found how to load the update manually. After following the steps and re-starting the app and completing the connection sequence the camera worked immediately.",
      "Included is small visual guide that details things like inserting and charging the rechargeable battery (included) and where to insert two micro SD cards (not included). The brochure shows how to attach the mounts or if not needed, completely remove the reciprocal portion attached to the camera. I next charged the battery with the included USB-C to USB-A cable. Cable length is approximately 18 inches.",
      "Battery charging takes approximately two hours. I noticed while charging the camera gets warm and during operation depending upon length of usage it can get hot. When not recording, the camera automatically turns off after 7 minutes.",
      "When recording a video the camera automatically saves the files in segments called chapters. These files are created every 5 minutes and each is approximately 4 GB. There is no way to alter chapter size but when played back directly from the camera the video appears seamless. When put together with editing software it also plays as one continuous video.",
      "The device is stated to be waterproof up to 16 feet. A tripod is also included along with three camera mounts to position the device either on a flat surface, a slightly concave or tripod. Comes with a zippered 3 1/2 by 3 1/2 by 1 1/2 inch semi-rigid storage case which should provide decent protection.\n"

      "\n  This is a great camera.  The video it takes looks amazing, better than anything else I've seen in the price range.  The pictures are great too.  It really adds an extra level to your vacation pics and vids when you can look around 360 degrees. I looked at a few alternatives, and the Fusion just had the best, natural looking videos, with the best color.  The app and desktop software is where it really falls off.  The app isn't fully functional on Samsung phones for some reason (only the world's largest phone manufacturer, that's all). You can't share videos from the phone.  The desktop software requires a really high-end CPU and a decent video card, and it's still very slow to render.  While on vacation I was able to render 360 pics on a cousins cheap laptop, but had to wait until I got home to render 360 video.",
      "Another issue is with the desktop app crashing all the time.  I have a high-end computer, i7-6700k 24GB RAM RTX 2080, and whenever I would render 5.2k or 5.6k videos, the app would start to consume all of my memory and then crash.  I read that turning-off 360 audio could fix it, but I want 360 audio, so I found this workaround.  In Windows 10, go to task manager, and the 'Details' tab.  Find the Fusion Studio app, right-click, select 'Set Affinity'.  You need to limit the number of corse the Fusion Studio app has access to.  You can play around with it to find the right mix, but I've found limiting it to Core 1, 2, and 3 works every time, but makes the rendering process even slower!",
      "Watching video is another issue.  My 5k video uploaded to Youtube seems to work fine everywhere.  I have an Oculus GO which couldn't handle the 5k video from the Fusion (very slow and choppy). The GO works with 4k exported video, but it looses some detail. My hi-res pictures worked fine on everything.",
      "The GoPro plus service works for this camera, but unfortunately they won't let you upload video to the cloud, which kills it IMO.  So basically all you get is the camera replacement service, for $5/month, plus you have to pay a deductible should you need a replacement.  Plus 50% off accessories, but it seems to me like the Gopro website has accessories twice the price as amazon anyways, so it's a wash.  Kind of a waste in my opinion, get the damage protection plan instead from the retailer.",
      "Overall, if you have a good computer, and you're willing to tinker around and figure out how to make this thing work, it's a great camera and takes amazing-looking videos.\n"

Even when the app is launched, it doesn't see the camera. What I end up doing is removing the twin micro-SD cards, reading them to a directory on the Mac, then forcing the app to look at that directory for stitching. Even on a fairly fast iMac, stitching is slow for photos and dreadfully slow for video.",
      "My biggest complaint is the color quality when taking photos indoors. Sure, I can often clear up the odd hues in post-processing, but I'm looking for a much faster workflow and don't want to spend the extra time doing color adjustment.",
      "If you're going to shoot outdoors exclusively, then by all means get the Fusion -- it excels on shooting photos and video outdoors. Just be aware that you're probably going to be frustrated with both the mobile and desktop apps. For indoor work, try something else because you'll be disappointed with the quality you get. This was my first GoPro product and will definitely be my last.\n"

Despite trying various usb ports, cables, and numerous suggestions found online I was unable to pull the footage off the camera and into the GoPro software. even when I pulled the SD cards and manually downloaded it, the software wouldn't recognize the files and spit out errors. its a shame because it was super simple to use out of the box but anything beyond hitting record is a nightmare. it also has constant issues turning on, i find myself having to pull the battery out, put it back in, just to get it to turn on. once its on, it works great, the voice commands and all, but getting it on is a challenge most of the times. I had it for about 48 hours and tried for nearly the same amount of time to pull the footage I captured on the first day. no luck, so, until they fix the software and crap ton of other issues, stay away from this bs.\n"

How can you offer no protection for the lens given the kinds of things your target audience wants to use it for???",

It's also prone to crashing a lot. They recently added support to the app for the cameras HDR functions, kind of. If you click on that menu option it just gives you instructions on using third party software. It's a workaround more than a feature.",

      "\n  Like an exotic sports car the up-front cost is only a portion of the capital investment you are making. Sure, if you already have an expensive smartphone you can connect to the GoPro fusion via the app and get some usability, but this approach has limitations with respect to stitching the image together into one, clear, spherical image. Where the GoPro Fusion really shines is when the images are processed on a desktop computer, the image is beautiful as if you are looking through a literal \"eye in the sky\". The one caveat (and it's a big one) is your desktop computer must be an absolute BEAST of a machine in order to process the footage in any reasonable amount of time, if at all before the RAM is exceeded and you have to give up hours later. To put this in perspective, you will probably need a video-processing desktop currently priced at $2K-$3K+. I have been successful at making clips up to 5 minutes long work on my computer with 8GB RAM and 2G DDR5 GPU, however, that is only after I had to tune down the resolution to 2K, and the stitching process still took over an hour. On the back end, the stitched videos are not compatible with past versions of the GoPro Studio software, which is a remarkably good and intuitive means of video editing (GoPro why did you move away from this?). As an alternative, GoPro opted to offer a GoPro Fusion toolbox for an Adobe video-editing software, which is only available via a subscription basis, minimum $20 per month with no option to straight-up purchase. At face value, this is an excellent option for a professional in the video-editing field, but I have neither the patience nor the presence to justify changing what has already worked in the past for me. I gave Adobe an honest attempt, but perhaps my computer was not up to par, nothing seemed to work.",
      "For me, as someone that works for a living and casually makes films of my adventures for Youtube that purchased the GoPro Fusion without buying the additional multi-thousand dollar desktop and has a dislike for a lack of options when I am required to go through a third-party software, I am limited to producing 5 minute long, RAW clips with no edits, to Youtube in 2K format. Right here right now this camera is a novelty with the ability to fire on all cylinders and blow away competitors IF you have deep pockets. What I would like to see is for GoPro to bring Fusion support to their now-unsupported GoPro Studio Desktop software similar to the software that Garmin developed for their 360 camera, very slick. Of course, this could all be corrected as well if GoPro redesigned the smartphone apps to be compatible with Fusion 360 footage so I can make actual 360 movies (not just Overcapture clips, 360 has more replay value to audience), improve stitching on the smartphone, and ensure the stitching process on smartphone doesn't crash once it reaches 100% (for no reason). I have hope GoPro can pull this off on the software side of the house, the problem does not seem to exist with the camera itself........except for ONE thing.......the fisheye lenses work great until you want to use them as literal fish eyes under the water, then the diffraction of the water will ensure that you lose approximately 40 degrees from your field of view, IMPOSSIBLE to create a spherical image, even in the clamshell housing that's available on Amazon for about $50. Fortunately that housing necessarily protects the lenses since there is now way you can drop this camera WITHOUT it landing directly on a lens and scratching it, the problem is that the fish-eye is so extreme the camera is actually looking bat at itself, which distorts the final image. To resolve this you should be able to sandwich two acrylic domes >4inch diameter around the camera which will minimize distortion.",

      "\n  Everything started with the purchase of the most overpriced, under-performing, unreliable camera I have ever seen. Bought a Session 5 right before a 28 days cruise. The camera just wouldn't work properly at all. After reading through the sea of complains in the forums a potential reason was shown (the memory card type could be the problem). I don't know enough about hardware to fully understand the complexity behind memory cards but if it is a subject so complicated then a memory card of the \"right\" type should be sold with the cameras. I wanted to return the camera right away but being in a cruise I missed my return window. I took the lost of $300 and moved on deciding to never give GoPro a chance with their poorly designed cameras. Today I get an email asking for my GoPro experience feedback. Decided that providing some constructive criticism would be useful. To my surprise, the survey had absolutely nothing to do with my experience with a GoPro camera at all! The survey was full of questions regarding demographics. I was in such a disbelief that GoPro would mask a demographic data collection survey as an experience feedback survey to bait people into providing data for GoPro's marketing. Maybe if your engineering team worked as well as your marketing team then GoPro wouldn't have the massive amount of unsuccessful products (such as Karma drone) out on the market. I had already been disappointed by GoPro beyond  repair but after this baiting survey, I will campaign as much as possible against your horrible products and your amazingly dirty social engineering methods of business.\n"

      "\n  Die Fusion ist der Beginn der Zukunft. Insbesondere bei Action-Aufnahmen muss man sich nicht mehr darum k\u00fcmmern den gew\u00fcnschten Bildausschnitt auch wirklich ins Bild zu bekommen. Man positioniert die Kamera einmal und nimmt nur noch auf. Danach bearbeitet man alles am PC und sucht sich die gew\u00fcnschten Perspektiven aus. Overcapture bietet unglaubliche Effekte und ist einfach genial. Die Bildqualit\u00e4t erstklassig, zumal man zB f\u00fcr YouTube Videos in der Regel auf 1080 Aufl\u00f6sung herunter geht. Also Bilder mega. Kamera selbst, gut, aber mit Verbesserungspotential. Die hervorstehenden fischaugenartigen 2 Linsen sind extrem exponiert und ohne jegliche Schutzoption. Die M\u00f6glichkeiten des Linsenschutzes wie bei Gopro Hero gibt es bisher nicht. Hier muss noch etwas nachgeholt werden. Ausserdem fehlt eine \u00d6se an der Kamera um eine Sicherungsleine zu befestigen. Da man die Fusion ohne Case verwendet, und es auch keines daf\u00fcr gibt, kann man an der Kamera selbst keine Safetyline anbringen, nur an der Schraube.",
      "Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Kritikpunkt ist allerdings die Software zur Nachbearbeitung. Auf der iPhone App funktioniert Overcapture zwar, aber wer will schon die sehr gro\u00dfen Datenmengen alle \u00fcber sein Handy abwickeln. Die Fusion Studio Software erlaubt auch Overcapture , aber richtig funktionieren mit allem was man sich zur Videobearbeitung so vorstellt tut es nur mit Premiere Pro. Dieses Programm ist aber mit \u00fcber 200 E / Jahr nicht billig, wenn auch gigantisch und genial. Zudem harmoniert es nur sehr schlecht mit Mac bzw OS. Ich verwende es an einem wirklich schnellen PC nun mit Windows 10 und das ist so wie ich es mir zur Videobearbeitung vorstelle. Wenn man die Fusion also zur Erstellung echter Videos mit Anspruch nutzen m\u00f6chte, dann wird es teuer. Daf\u00fcr gibt es dann tolle Bilder und keine Grenzen bei der Phantasie der Videobearbeitung . Ich w\u00fcrde mir die Fusion trotz aller Kritikpunkte wieder kaufen, weil es diese M\u00f6glichkeiten sonst nirgends gibt. Wer nur 360 -Grad-Fotos machen will hat es einfacher. Das geht super \u00fcber die iPhone App und die Bilder lassen sich direkt daraus teilen. Auch schon toll, aber die Videos sind eine andere Dimension.\n"

El de OSX es b\u00e1sico y con problemas, no entiendo como el comprimir en H264 no mantiene la resoluci\u00f3n de partida. Esto implica siempre tratar en PRORES y para el almacenamiento no es \u00f3ptimo. Dado el tiempo que se dedica a renderizar es poco operativo su uso.",

      "\n  Das Konzept der Kamera gut, es macht viel Spa\u00df damit aufzunehmen. Es w\u00e4re alles gut, wenn da nicht die notwendige Nachbearbeitung w\u00e4re. Die Windows-Software, die daf\u00fcr n\u00f6tig ist (GoPro Fusion Studio) ist schlichtweg eine Katastrophe. Sie beansprucht f\u00fcr die Bearbeitung _alle_ Systemressourcen, auch jeglichen freien Speicherplatz auf der Systemplatte. Das w\u00e4re ja auch noch in Ordnung, leider st\u00fcrzt sie im Schnitt bei jedem zweitem Render-Prozess ab und gibt den belegten Festplattenplatz NICHT WIEDER FREI. Das Windows-System ist dadurch nur noch eingeschr\u00e4nkt nutzbar. Die Anfrage an den GoPro Support (nur in englisch) offenbart die generelle Taktik: ABWIMMELN. Ich habe das Problem geschildert, der Mitarbeiter hat es bis zum Schluss nicht verstanden und die Konversation endete mit der Aufforderung, \"ich solle jemanden Fragen, der sich mit Computern auskennt\". Dazu muss ich sagen, ich bin selbst Softwareentwicker. Es wurde mir versprochen dass sich ein \"Experte\" mit mir per eMail in Verbindung setzt, das ist nach mehrere Wochen immer noch nicht passiert. Jegliche erneute Anfragen zum gleichen Thema werden konsequent ignoriert. F\u00fcr mich gibt es nur einen Begriff daf\u00fcr: UNPROFESSIONELL.\n"

      "\n  Wie die meisten hier, bin auch ich sehr unzufrieden mit der App. Laut Gopro h\u00e4tte mein Huawei Mate 20 Pro eine Verbindung herstellen k\u00f6nnen. Allerdings kam dann auch dort die Benachrichtigung dass die Ger\u00e4te nicht kompatibel sind.",
      "Durch gewisse Tutorials konnte ich dann doch noch eine Verbindung \u00fcber Umwege herstellen. Dadurch konnte ich immerhin das Aktuelle Bild sehen, bereits gefilmte Videos anschauen und Fotos angucken. Allerdings hat die Download Funktion nicht funktioniert. Also konnte man unterwegs immer noch nichts mit dem Material anfangen.",
      "Was viele als positiv bewerten bei der Fusion, ist das Stiching, also das Filmmaterial beider Kameras. Ich kann das leider nicht bef\u00fcrworten. Es gab einen sehr sichtbaren \u00dcbergang, der leicht versetzt war und f\u00fcr mich als st\u00f6rend empfunden wurde. Daher musste man manche perspektiven \u00e4ndern, damit man es nicht sehen konnte. Ich muss dazu sagen, dass ich auch kein Vergleich zu anderen 360\u00b0 Kameras habe, daher eine rein objektive Meinung von mir.",
      "Pro:",
      "- Stabilisierung: Einfach genial. Auf dem Snowboard oder Skiern absolut kein wackeln zu sehen!",
      "- Akku: Fand ich auch sehr gut. Mindestens eine Stunde reine Filmzeit war immer drin.",
      "- Qualit\u00e4t: 5,2K/30fps auch sehr positiv. Selbst bei schnellen Aufnahmen war das Bild immer recht klar und fl\u00fcssig.",
      "- Lieferumfang: Der beiliegende Stick ist qualitativ hochwertig. Eine Schlaufe hat leider gefehlt. Sehr vorteilhaft ist auch die kleine Tasche f\u00fcr die Kamera, die man auch \u00fcberziehen konnte, wenn die Gopro gerade an dem Stick angeschraubt ist.",
      "Kontra:",
      "- App und Smartphone Kompatibilit\u00e4ten",
      "- \u00dcbergang der Front/Back Kamera",
      "- Preis/Leistung: Aktuell einfach zu teuer f\u00fcr das was man dort geliefert bekommt. Wenn die ganzen Softwareprobleme abgestellt sind, dann w\u00e4re es noch eine \u00dcberlegung wert. Das war der Hauptgrund f\u00fcr eine R\u00fccksendung, die dank Amazon immer wieder sehr einfach gestaltet ist.",
      "Fazit: Leider muss man abwarten bis die Softwareprobleme gel\u00f6st sind, oder eine komplett neue Version der Fusion herauskommt.\n"

      "\n  The big let down of almost all 360 cameras I\u2019ve used has been the user interface or the image stitching. Took the GoPro fusion to the climbing centre last night and the results are impressive. The camera produces great quality high resolution images and the user interface on the GoPro app allows you to make great photos in seconds. Videos are not as convinient to do. But that\u2019s the nature of 5K resolution unfortunately.",

      "\n  I wanted to really like this camera, but GoPro's desktop and mobile app to process the 360 footage needs more work before it's ready for consumer use. The minimum computer requirements for the desktop app is totally understated by GoPro. The graphics card needs to be at least a GTX 1050 for reasonable stitching times (6 minutes of stitching time for every minute of footage). The mobile app for iOS needs proper stitching for 360 stills. 360 video stitches fine on the phone, but stitching for 360 stills is practically non-existent. How did software quality control miss this??? And there's also no way to control the horizon orientation when panning around 360 footage - it just spins in seemingly random directions. GoPro, please take a look at how Ricoh did their app for the Theta and take some notes.\n"

Nimmt beim Shooting ein wenig Denkarbeit ab, und kann f\u00fcr ziemlich cool anmutende Shootings sorgen - jedoch sollte man sich f\u00fcr eine passende Perspektive nat\u00fcrlich dennoch entsprechende Gedanken machen, wie und wo die Kamera entsprechend positioniert wird.",

Hier kann eventuell noch an der App nachgebessert werden, so dass das Rendering zwar l\u00e4nger dauert, aber grunds\u00e4tzlich halt noch m\u00f6glich ist. Desweiteren wird die angeschlossene Kamera nicht mehr als Laufwerk angezeigt; Material muss hier \u00fcber \"Digitale Bilder\" importiert werden, das die Kamera tadellos erkennt.",

      "\n  In terms of the quality of the camera there is no doubt that this has the same excellent quality as the other GoPro cameras. The videos are crisp, vibrant, beautiful, and the battery literally lasts forever. However, that's about all that's praise-worthy for this camera.",
      "It is far heavier than any other GoPro cameras I've ever seen/owned/used. Like big-brick-on-top-of-your-head heavy....not to mention it's much bulkier. I get it has more functions but the bulkiness is a huge set-back for me. In addition, the software they use is not compatible with my One Plus phone, and it took me a long tedious time to find that out so I couldn't really use the camera to it's fullest potential.",
      "I get they're trying to cram 100 features into one product, but at least it should work. Especially for the almost one grand price tag.\n"

      "\n  Totale Entt\u00e4uschung, Gopro hat massiv nachgelassen. Hatte vorher die Hero 4. Die Fusion macht zuerst einen guten Eindruck, doch hat massive Detailschw\u00e4chen: Beim Surfen eingesetzt, kommt Sand durch die Dichtungen und macht das \u00d6ffnen des Akkuschachts extrem schwerg\u00e4ngig. F\u00fcr den anderen Schachthat sich die Abdceckung beim \u00d6ffnen komplett verabschiedet. Konnektivit\u00e4t funktioniert nur zu Quick, nicht zu Mac. Das ist echt Mist, und h\u00e4tte ich bnoch die Originalverpackung, w\u00fcrde ich das Ding einfach zur\u00fcckschicken. Schade, so macht Gopro sich selbst kaputt\n"

      "\n  Die Actioncam ist f\u00fcr vielf\u00e4ltige Eins\u00e4tze bestens geeignet. Sie ist mit ca. 7,5 x 7,5 x 4 cm sehr kompakt und robust gebaut. Die Oberfl\u00e4che ist gummiert und was besonders gut ist, alle Kanten sind abgerundet. Die beiden Kameraaugen stehen logischerweise hervor, sonst k\u00f6nnte man den 360 Grad Winkel nicht gut abdecken. Sicherlich ist hier besondere Vorsicht geboten, denn schon beim Hinlegen liegt die Kamera immer auf der Linse. Das mitgelieferte kompakte Cover ist daher sehr praktisch, weil man die Kamera dort sehr gut, schnell und sicher verstauen kann. Die beiden Klappen f\u00fcr den Akku und die beiden microSDHC-Karten einerseits und den USB-C Anschluss andererseits sind als Schub- und Gelenk-Klappen ausgebildet. Sie lassen sich trotz der Dichtungen leicht bedienen. Die Funktionsweise ist relativ einfach, zuerst wird die Klappe mit der innenliegenden Dichtung mit dem Schubdeckel fest angedr\u00fcckt und der Schubdeckel eingeschoben. Dadurch wird verhindert, dass sich die Dichtung mit der Zeit abreibt und undicht wird. So eine Konstruktion ist immer eine sehr gute und dichtungsschonende Variante, die auf Langlebigkeit ausgelegt ist. Sicherlich m\u00fcssen die Dichtungen und die Schubrillen auf Sauberkeit \u00fcberpr\u00fcft werden, denn Schmutz und Staub k\u00f6nnen die Klappenmechanik erheblich besch\u00e4digen. Die Tasten zum \u00d6ffnen der Klappen sowie die beiden Bedienschalter sind gut zug\u00e4nglich, bedienbar und funktionieren sehr gut. Das Display zum Einstellen der Funktionen ist ca. 1,5 x 1,5 cm gro\u00df und gut beleuchtet. Die Symbole, Zahlen und Buchstaben sind gut lesbar. Auch die Bedienung durch die beiden Tasten ist sehr gut. Die Men\u00fcf\u00fchrung und die Einstellungen sind selbsterkl\u00e4rend und genau so muss es sein. Hier k\u00f6nnen Einstellungen f\u00fcr Videos, Photos, Zeitrafferaufnahmen, Sprachsteuerung und die Verbindungsart f\u00fcr die Kommunikation mit dem Smartphone, PC-Tablet usw. vorgenommen werden. Es stehen beide B\u00e4nder f\u00fcr WLAN zur Verf\u00fcgung 2,4 GHz und 5 GHz. Der Akku ist ein Li-ion Akku mit 2620 mAh. Schade, dass hier nicht zwei AA-Standard-Eneloope-Akkus mit zusammen 5000 mAh gew\u00e4hlt wurden, denn vom Platz her w\u00fcrden sie passen. Man k\u00f6nnte schnell mal zwischendurch die Akkus wechseln und zus\u00e4tzlich hatte man noch die doppelte Kapazit\u00e4t. Die zwei nicht im Lieferumfang beinhalteten microSDHC-Karten m\u00fcssen immer sehr schnelle Karten sein. Wir verwenden bereits bei unseren Smartphones und Dashcams die SanDisk microSDHC mit UHS-I oder h\u00f6her sowie mit Class 10. Langsame SD-Karten werden der Actioncam nicht gerecht. Der GoPro typische Anschluss l\u00e4sst sich nach dem L\u00f6sen der beiden Arretierklappen herausschieben und je nach Bedarf austauschen.",
      "Die mitgelieferten Fixierungen f\u00fcr plane und gew\u00f6lbte Oberfl\u00e4chen haften gut, vorausgesetzt der Untergrund wurde vorher sehr gut gereinigt und vor allem entfettet. Die Selfiestange ist im ausgezogenem Zustand ca. 58 cm lang. Sehr sch\u00f6n ist dabei, da\u00df der Griff zu einem Dreifu\u00df umfunktioniert werden kann. Somit hat man nicht nur einen Dreifu\u00df, sondern, wenn man will, einen Dreifu\u00df mit Teleskop. Das ist sehr n\u00fctzlich und praktisch.",
      "Die Actioncam liefert sehr gute 360 Grad Bilder in einer hohen Sch\u00e4rfe. Mit Gegen- und seitlichem Licht kann sie erstaunlicherweise sehr gut umgehen. Die Farbbrillanz und weitere Einstellungen k\u00f6nnen mit der Software eingestellt werden. Die n\u00f6tige Software f\u00fcr die Bearbeitung kann von der GoPro-Internetseite heruntergeladen werden. Es ist GoPro Fusion Studio, GoPro Quick und der GoPro VR Player. Die Software l\u00e4uft allerdings nur auf 64-bit Systemen. Wir haben sie auf Rechnern mit Windows 10 Enterprise 64 bit laufen und das funktioniert gut. Vor der ersten Inbetriebnahme sollte man allerdings ein Update der Software f\u00fcr die Actioncam durchf\u00fchren. Eine Registrierung ist notwendig.",
      "Die Handhabung ist sehr einfach und selbsterkl\u00e4rend. Wer mit Actioncams bereits erste Erfahrungen gemacht hat, wird sich hier sehr schnell zurechtfinden. Beim Anschluss an einen PC, Tablet usw. wird die Actioncam sofort erkannt und man kann auf die einzelnen Dateien auch problemlos zugreifen. Das Aufladen des Akkus geht \u00fcber herk\u00f6mmliche USB-Lader ebenfalls problemlos. Ein USB-A zu USB-C \u2013 Kabel liegt bei. Auch das Aufladen im Auto oder durch ein Akku-Backup (Gr\u00f6\u00dfer 5.000 mAh) ist m\u00f6glich. Bei Akku-Backups und Photovoltaik-Ladern ist wichtig, dass die Kapazit\u00e4t von mindesten 2620 mAh \u00fcberschritten werden kann, sonst wird der Akku nie voll. \u00dcbrigens kann man die Actioncam laden und gleichzeitig aufzeichnen lassen. Das haben wir im Auto gemacht. Wir setzen diese Profi-Actioncam sehr gerne als Dashcam im Auto ein und daf\u00fcr ist sie ebenfalls perfekt geeignet, sie zeichnet n\u00e4mlich gleichzeitig 360 Grad auf, also vorne, hinten und die Seiten. Besser geht es nicht! F\u00fcr uns ersetzt die GoPro Fusion ab sofort die anderen Dashcams. Diese Actioncam ist nicht nur eine Actioncam, sondern auch eine 360 Grad \u201eBeweiscam\u201c mit Ton. Das ist perfekt!",
      "Die Neuentwicklung der 360 Grad GoPro ist sehr gut und aus unsere Sicht sehr professionell. Sicherlich w\u00e4re sch\u00f6n, wenn die Software noch mehr Features h\u00e4tte, denn herausholen kann man aus den Aufzeichnungen noch weitaus mehr.",
      "Ein sehr gutes, qualitativ sehr hochwertiges und sehr gut und sauber verarbeitetes Produkt.\n"
